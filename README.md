# Laracasts Series - CSS Flexbox Simplified

This is the starter branch for all the examples in the course. If you want to code along with me, clone this branch.

1. Each directory contains examples shown in the corresponding episode. Directory 1 contains the examples used in Episode 1, and so on upto 12 directories.
2. The code in each directory in this branch is the starting point for each episode.
3. The CSS file `base.css` at the root contains many general styles used across all the examples. These are not really important for the concepts covered in this course.
4. If you want to compare your code at the end of any episode, checkout the `main` branch. The `main` branch contains the same 12 directories with complete working demos.
